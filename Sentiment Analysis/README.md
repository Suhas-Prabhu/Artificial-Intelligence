Sentiment analysis is the use of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and other data analysis techniques to analyze and derive objective quantitative results from raw text. It measures the attitude of the customer towards the aspects of a service or product which they describe in text.This typically involves taking a piece of text, whether it’s a sentence, a comment or an entire document and returning a “score” that measures how positive or negative the text is.
